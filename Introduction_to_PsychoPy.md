# Introduction to PsychoPy

## Overview
### What is PsychoPy?
PsychoPy is a free, open-source software package for the creation of experiments in psychology. It is written in Python, a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-learn programming language. PsychoPy is designed to be easy to use, and it is suitable for both novice and experienced programmers.

## Tool examples
*How to use*: You can click the link and download the whole folder from gitlab. You may have to sign up for an account to get access to the repository. All data, code and stimuli should be included in the folder. You can run the experiement on you own computer, and use the data for practice.

*Note*: I've encountered some issues with the newest version of psychopy (2024.1.3). If you have trouble running the experiment, please try to install an older version (2021.2.3).
