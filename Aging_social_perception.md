# Literature on Aging and Social Trait Perception

## Overview
This project aims to investigate the relationship between aging and social trait perception.
Current research on person perception are mostyly based on young faces. Researchers found young faces can be placed in a social trait space with several main dimensions, such as warmth and competence. However, it is unclear whether these dimensions can be applied to older face. We want to explore:
1. Would the same dimensions be used to evaluate older faces? Are they of the same importance?
2. As people age, what changes in social trait perception occur? Are they consistent across different racial groups or social groups (occupation-wise, social status-wise)?
3. Consider the mutual influence between target and perceiver, would the perception of aged target be influenced by the age of the perceiver?
